# Force npm to always resolve packages from the public npm registry.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
# The package-lock.json was previously generated inside an environment that
# sits behind Microsoft's internal Artifactory npm mirror:
#   packages.applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org/artifactory/api/npm/npm-public/
#
# That mirror's URLs are hardcoded in the "resolved" field of every entry in
# package-lock.json. GitHub Actions runners are on the public internet and
# cannot reach that internal address, which causes ETIMEDOUT during npm install.
#
# This .npmrc file overrides any inherited or lockfile-embedded registry so
# that npm always downloads from registry.npmjs.org on every environment,
# including GitHub Actions runners, local developer machines, and Azure.
#
# After the workflow runs once successfully, a clean package-lock.json will be
# generated (with registry.npmjs.org URLs) and committed. At that point this
# file is still safe to keep — it is a no-op when the lockfile is already clean.
