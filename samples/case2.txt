Henry Sharp, Defendant in Error.\nThis was an action of slander brought in the Washington circuit court by Blair and wife, against Sharp. Prom the agreed case, it appears, that the only words charged in the declaration to have been spoken of the plaintiff by the defendant, were, that the plaintiff \u201c had swore a lie.\u201d There was no colloquium showing how, or on what occasion the lie was sworn. The court below declared the declaration insufficient, and that the words as stated, were not actionable. To reverse that judgment, a writ of error was sued out by plaintiff.\nERROR TO WASHINGTON.\nAn omission of a colloquium, in a declaration for slander in charging the plaintiff with swearing a lie, is fatal.\n(1)\n(1) Such was the rule of the common law, but it is now materially changed in this state, by statute. Section 2, page 1137, Scate\u2019s Comp\u2019l. Purple\u2019s Statutes, page 1126, provides that, \u201cIt shall be deemed slander, and shall be actionable, to charge any person with swearing falsely, or with having swore falsely, or for using, uttering or publishing words of, to, or concerning any person, which in their common acceptation, amount to such charge, whether the words be spoken in conversation of and concerning a judicial proceeding or not.\u201d And under this statute the court held that \u201c Words which, in their common acceptation, amount to a charge of having sworn falsely, are actionable, whether spoken of and concerning a judicial proceeding or not; and are none the less actionable because the declaration avers that they were spoken in a conversation concerning a judicial proceeding.\u201d \u201cIt is not necessary that the words spoken in a conversation concerning a judicial proceeding, should be spoken under such circumstances as to impute the crime of pequry.\u201d Sanford v. Gaddis, 13 Ills., 329.\nIn an action of slander for words used charging false swearing, where the defendant by his pleas has based his defense on the fact that the plaintiff was guilty of perjury, he will be required to prove the fact of the perjury. He must make out the defense which he has chosen in his pleadings, even though he was not obliged to charge perjury in order to justify the words spoken. Hicks v. Rising, 24 Ill., 566\nThe first section of the statute above referred to also provides that \u201c If any person shall falsely use, utter or publish words which, in their common acceptation, shall amount to charge any person with having been guilty of fornication or adultery, such words so spoken shall be deemed actionable, and he, she or they, so falsely publishing, speaking or uttering the same, shall be deemed guilty of slander.\u201d And under that section of the statute the court said: \u201cWords, which in their common acceptation, amount to a charge of fornication, are slanderous, and are actionable without colloquium or innuendo; and the latter, if used, is at most but surplusage.\u201d Elam v. Badger, 23 Ill., 498.\nIn an action of slander for words charging the plaintiff with fornication or adultery, no reference need be made in the pleadings to the statute on that subject, id.", "judges": []}}}

The court knows of no power in the administrator, by virtue of the trust conferred on him by law, to loan the money belonging to the estate ; if he does it, he acts upon his own responsibility, and renders himself liable to the estate. The note was made to West alone, and for that reason, the suit should have been commenced in his name, and a joinder of his co-administrators was improper, as no right of action, to recover the amount of the note, existed in them. Without determining any other question, for this ground alone, the court affirms the judgment,\n(a)\n(1)\nJudgment affirmed.\n(a) Vide Toller\u2019s law of executors, page 480, where it is declared, that in equity, an executor may be compelled to pay interest, if he suffers the money of the estate to lie idle in his hands.

Dexter v. Arnold, et al., 3 Mason, 248.\n(1) Admitting that the administrator had no right to loan the money, how could the defendant take advantage of it 1 He executed his note to the plaintiff as administrator, and to him it was immaterial whether he was liable to the administrator personally, or in his representative character. Persons interested in the estate might, perhaps, object that the administrator had transcended his duty, and might hold him responsible for it; but if they are content with his actions it is not easily perceived how the defendant can complain.\nIn Marsh et al. v. The People, 15 Ill., 284, it was held that when three were appointed administrators, each was liable for the acts of the others.

On the first point, there is no case within the recollection of the court, in which it has been considered error, to grant a continuance. The third objection will depend very much upon the same principle, that granting continuances and new trials, is so much a matter of discretion, that an appellate court can not undertake to inquire into the proper exercise of that discretion, in a case like the present. The court, however, must not be understood as saying, that in no case would it make the inquiry. If a case was brought up, upon bill of exceptions containing all the facts, it would furnish this court with the means of forming an opinion, as to the proper exercise or abuse of the discretion of the court below.\n(1)\nThe second error assigned, is considered equally untenable. The swearing the jury, is matter of form, and if not objected to at the time, an irregularity in the manner of swearing them, can not afterwards be assigned as error. There is no judgment of the court upon the point, and the jury is presumed to take into consideration the whole matter, and if their intention is manifest, the court will set right mere matters of form.
